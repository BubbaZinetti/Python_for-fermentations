# Python_for-fermentations
This is where I attempt to use Matplot to produce  P. pastoris fermentation plots.
I have started learning Python because the native control software for fermentations produces plots that are difficult to print and read.    
I have received an assist from a colleague on the actual plot and I have been working on using the .csv or .xlsx file to create the lists.
I have taken only very basic courses in Python, and I have some experience in R.  
I am using Jupyter to generate the code and searching everywhere for solutions.

Expanding on this.  I have used this rudimentary program many times as of 12Aug2021.  Tweaking the columns, labels, and colors allows for a customizable plot.  I still struggle because I am a beginner, but this has turned out to be a useful tool.  Future iterations will feature some tweaks like putting all of the y-axes on the right of the plot to be more in line with how BioCommand or the fermenter displays the data.
